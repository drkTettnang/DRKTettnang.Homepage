Quickstart
==========

After working through this guide, you will have learned:

* the structure of a form
* creating a form using the API
* rendering a form
* adding validation rules
* invoking actions after the form is finished

API Overview
------------

The image below shows the high-level API overview of the this package.

First, we will dive into the API part *defining a form*, and then go over to
*rendering a form*. In later chapters, we will also show how loading / saving
a form definition works.

Anatomy of a Form
-----------------

A form is described by the so-called :api-core-model:`FormDefinition`, which is a container object
for the form that consists of one or more ``Pages`` in which the actual ``FormElements`` are located.

As an example, let's take a basic contact form with the following structure:

* Contact Form *(Form)*
    * Page 01 *(Page)*
        * Name *(Single-line Text)*
        * Email *(Single-line Text)*
        * Message *(Multi-line Text)*

Our form just has a single page that contains three input fields: Name, Email
and Message.

.. note:: Every form needs to have at least one page.

.. admonition:: Further Information

	In-depth information about the form structure can be found in the
	:api-core-model:`FormDefinition` API Documentation.

Create your first form
----------------------

Now, let's try to create the basic contact form from above.
For this we need to implement a so-called :api-factory:`FormFactory <AbstractFormFactory>`,
which is responsible for creating the form. The skeleton for building a form
looks as follows::

	namespace Your\Package;

	use TYPO3\Flow\Annotations as Flow;
	use TYPO3\Form\Core\Model\FormDefinition;

	class QuickstartFactory extends \TYPO3\Form\Factory\AbstractFormFactory {

		/**
		 * @param array $factorySpecificConfiguration
		 * @param string $presetName
		 * @return \TYPO3\Form\Core\Model\FormDefinition
		 */
		public function build(array $factorySpecificConfiguration, $presetName) {
			$formConfiguration = $this->getPresetConfiguration($presetName);
			$form = new FormDefinition('yourFormIdentifier', $formConfiguration);
			// Now, build your form here
			return $form;
		}
	}

As you can see there is the ``build()`` method that you have to implement; and this method
needs to return the :api-core-model:`FormDefinition`.

Lets add the one page and input fields for *name*, *email* and *message* of our contact form::

	public function build(array $factorySpecificConfiguration, $presetName) {
		$formConfiguration = $this->getPresetConfiguration($presetName);
		$form = new FormDefinition('contactForm', $formConfiguration);

		$page1 = $form->createPage('page1');

		$name = $page1->createElement('name', 'TYPO3.Form:SingleLineText');
		$name->setLabel('Name');

		$email = $page1->createElement('email', 'TYPO3.Form:SingleLineText');
		$email->setLabel('Email');

		$comments = $page1->createElement('message', 'TYPO3.Form:MultiLineText');
		$comments->setLabel('Message');

		return $form;
	}

You see that we used the API method ``createPage($identifier)``, which creates a new page inside
the form object and returns it for further use. Then, we used ``createElement($identifier, $type)``
to create the form elements and set some options on them.

The ``$identifier`` is used to identify a form element, thus it needs to be unique
across the whole form. ``$type`` references an **Element Type**.

.. note:: By default the ``$identifier`` is part of the `id` attribute of the rendered Form Element so it should be lowerCamelCased and must not contain special characters.

.. tip:: As you will learn in the next guide, you can define your own **Element Types** easily.
   The element types referenced above (``TYPO3.Form:SingleLineText`` and ``TYPO3.Form:MultiLineText``)
   are just element types which are delivered by default by the framework.

Render a form
-------------

Now that we have created the first FormDefinition how can we display the actual form?
That is really easy with the provided :api-viewhelpers:`form:render <Render>` ViewHelper:

::

	{namespace form=TYPO3\Form\ViewHelpers}
	<form:render factoryClass="Your\Package\YourFactory" />

If you put that snippet in your Fluid template and replace `Your\Package` with your package
namespace and `YourFactory` with the class name of the previously generated form factory,
you should see a form consisting of the three text fields and a submit button.

But as you can see, none of the fields are required and the email address is not
verified. So let's add some basic validation rules:

Validation
----------

Every :api-core-model:`FormElement <AbstractFormElement>` implements the :api-core-model:`FormElementInterface`
which provides a convenient way to work with TYPO3 Flow validators::

	$name->addValidator(new \TYPO3\Flow\Validation\Validator\NotEmptyValidator());

	$email->addValidator(new \TYPO3\Flow\Validation\Validator\NotEmptyValidator());
	$email->addValidator(new \TYPO3\Flow\Validation\Validator\EmailAddressValidator());

	$comments->addValidator(new \TYPO3\Flow\Validation\Validator\NotEmptyValidator());
	$comments->addValidator(new \TYPO3\Flow\Validation\Validator\StringLengthValidator(array('minimum' => 3)));

With the ``addValidator($validator)`` method you can attach one or more validators to a form element.
If you save the changes and reload the page where you embedded the form, you can see that
all text fields are required now, that the email address is syntactically verified and that
you need to write a message of at least 3 characters. If you try to submit the form with
invalid data, validation errors are displayed next to each erroneous field.

If you do enter name, a valid email address and a message you can submit the
form - and see a blank page. That's where so called **Finishers** come into play.

Finishers
---------

A :api-core-model:`Finisher <FinisherInterface>` is a piece of PHP code that is executed
as soon as a form has been successfully submitted (if the last page has been sent
and no validation errors occurred).

You can attach multiple finishers to a form.

For this example we might want to send the data to an email address, and we can use
the :api-finishers:`EmailFinisher` for that::

	$emailFinisher = new \TYPO3\Form\Finishers\EmailFinisher();
	$emailFinisher->setOptions(array(
		'templatePathAndFilename' => 'resource://Your.Package/Private/Templates/ContactForm/NotificationEmail.txt',
		'recipientAddress' => 'your@example.com',
		'senderAddress' => 'mailer@example.com',
		'replyToAddress' => '{email}',
		'subject' => 'Contact Request',
		'format' => \TYPO3\Form\Finishers\EmailFinisher::FORMAT_PLAINTEXT
	));
	$form->addFinisher($emailFinisher);

And afterwards we want to redirect the user to some confirmation action, thus
we add the :api-finishers:`RedirectFinisher`::

	$redirectFinisher = new \TYPO3\Form\Finishers\RedirectFinisher();
	$redirectFinisher->setOptions(
		array('action' => 'confirmation')
	);
	$form->addFinisher($redirectFinisher);

Summary
-------

That's it for the quickstart. The complete code of your form factory should look something like this now:

::

	namespace Your\Package;

	use TYPO3\Flow\Annotations as Flow;
	use TYPO3\Form\Core\Model\FormDefinition;

	/**
	 * Flow\Scope("singleton")
	 */
	class QuickstartFactory extends \TYPO3\Form\Factory\AbstractFormFactory {

		/**
		 * @param array $factorySpecificConfiguration
		 * @param string $presetName
		 * @return \TYPO3\Form\Core\Model\FormDefinition
		 */
		public function build(array $factorySpecificConfiguration, $presetName) {
			$formConfiguration = $this->getPresetConfiguration($presetName);
			$form = new FormDefinition('contactForm', $formConfiguration);

			$page1 = $form->createPage('page1');

			$name = $page1->createElement('name', 'TYPO3.Form:SingleLineText');
			$name->setLabel('Name');
			$name->addValidator(new \TYPO3\Flow\Validation\Validator\NotEmptyValidator());

			$email = $page1->createElement('email', 'TYPO3.Form:SingleLineText');
			$email->setLabel('Email');
			$email->addValidator(new \TYPO3\Flow\Validation\Validator\NotEmptyValidator());
			$email->addValidator(new \TYPO3\Flow\Validation\Validator\EmailAddressValidator());

			$comments = $page1->createElement('message', 'TYPO3.Form:MultiLineText');
			$comments->setLabel('Message');
			$comments->addValidator(new \TYPO3\Flow\Validation\Validator\NotEmptyValidator());
			$comments->addValidator(new \TYPO3\Flow\Validation\Validator\StringLengthValidator(array('minimum' => 3)));

			$emailFinisher = new \TYPO3\Form\Finishers\EmailFinisher();
			$emailFinisher->setOptions(array(
				'templatePathAndFilename' => 'resource://Your.Package/Private/Templates/ContactForm/NotificationEmail.txt',
				'recipientAddress' => 'your@example.com',
				'senderAddress' => 'mailer@example.com',
				'replyToAddress' => '{email}',
				'subject' => 'Contact Request',
				'format' => \TYPO3\Form\Finishers\EmailFinisher::FORMAT_PLAINTEXT
			));
			$form->addFinisher($emailFinisher);

			$redirectFinisher = new \TYPO3\Form\Finishers\RedirectFinisher();
			$redirectFinisher->setOptions(
				array('action' => 'confirmation')
			);
			$form->addFinisher($redirectFinisher);

			return $form;
		}
	}
