`BUGFIX: User workspace names should be deterministic <https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/pull/311>`_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This fixes some inconsistencies with the naming of user workspaces,
which resulted in duplicate workspaces being created for users with
special characters in their username.

Additionally a migration that can correctly set the owner for users
with usernames containing special characters was added.

`BUGFIX: Fix unicode handling in help messages <https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/pull/310>`_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently help messages are broken with unicode strings, because
`DOMDocument::loadHTML` needs correct encoding declaration to handle
unicode correctly.

Append the encoding declaration to fix this issue.
