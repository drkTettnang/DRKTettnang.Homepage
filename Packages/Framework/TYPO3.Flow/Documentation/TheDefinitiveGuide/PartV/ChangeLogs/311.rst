`TASK: Fix code style after merge <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/208>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Packages: ``Flow`` ``Fluid``

`BUGFIX: StringHelper::startsWith broken with multiple occurance <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/204>`_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In case the search string appeared multiple times in the haystack
startsWith would not correctly report the occurance at the beginning
as it used the same code as endsWith. This is now fixed by using
``mb_strpos`` instead ``mb_strrpos``.

`BUGFIX: Make sure Fluid parser is configured correctly <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/203>`_
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When ``AbstractTemplateView::renderSection`` is called on a section that
has partials inside, it can happen that for parsing the partial the
ParserConfiguration is not set. This depends on the cache status of the
section and partial template.

If this happens, no Interceptors are applied to the partial. As that
includes the Escaping interceptor it might be a "security issue" when
the system runs in development context.

`BUGFIX: AOP Proxies properly check method existance before upward delegation <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/200>`_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The usage of method_exists() checks inside the proxy class code was wrong by checking
the existence on the parent class of $this, which might in some circumstances not be
the current proxy class (ie. when checking method was originally called from a doctrine proxy).

This change fixes the method_exists calls by using the get_parent_class() without
parameter. Also, the method_exists check is added to the remaining method checks, that
currently only rely on is_callable, which in turn is always true on hierarchies that implement
__call magic method.

`BUGFIX: ResourceStreamWrapper now saves handles for resource:// - URIs <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/199>`_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Trying to use file_get_contents("resource://yourhashhere") led to an exception in the StreamWrapper.
This fix addresses the issue by correctly setting the StreamWrapper handle to the opened resource.

Additionally a test is provided to demonstrate the problem.

`BUGFIX: Default constructor arguments only autowired if needed <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/202>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So far all constructor arguments were treated as autowired unless
configured otherwise. This can result in problems and one example
is seen with the constructor of ArrayObject starting from PHP 7.0.2.

Unfortunately PHP does not allow Reflection of built-in functions
arguments. This includes methods of built-in classes like ArrayObject.
This results in our ReflectionService to report null as default for
those arguments which will then be autowired. Since PHP 7.0.2 all three
arguments of the ArrayObject constructor are reported correctly by
Reflection but due to our autowiring the third argument will be given
as null in the proxy class which results in a fatal error.

The solution is to mark configured arguments that use the default or null
to be not autowired and do not give them to the original constructor if
they are not followed by an autowired argument.

FLOW-431 #close Fixes the issue by changing the way we apply default values

`[TASK] Include Exception class in ExceptionHandler with full path <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1>`_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ExceptionHandler includes the Flow Exception class directly by using
the relative path. This might not work out if at some point we decide to
combine autoloaded classes as this class is autoloaded and the relative
path will be wrong then. Using the FLOW_PATH_FLOW constant we can easily
construct a full path to the file.
